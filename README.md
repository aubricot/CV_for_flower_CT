# CV_for_flower_CT
Computer vision for micro-CT datasets of flowers
*Last updated 15 March 2025*

The code in this repository is used to evaluate computer vision as a tool for analyzing floral micro-CT datasets of cacao (*Theobroma cacao*). It is built in Google Colab Notebooks with Python 3 and MONAI Label 1.5.
